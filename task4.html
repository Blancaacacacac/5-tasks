  <br />
  <br />
  <div>Great, how was the travel? Was it fun? </div>
  <br />
    <br />
      <br />
  <div>Well, I went back to China and stayed at home.</div>
  <br />
  <div>China.</div>
  <br />
  <div>Yeah, I went to Hangzhou with my parents and Shanghai with my</div>
  <div>younger friend. I was in Shanghai for high school, so I visited some</div>
  <div> of my friends and got some great food in Shanghai.</div>
  <br />
  <div>Yeah there’s something like it in China; almost like a monorail. </div>
    <div>How was your Christmas?</div>

  </p1>

<p2>
  <div>It was good, just some family business and I went to Chicago with my roommates.</div>
    <br />
  <div>It was nice, we went to the movies and enjoyed the sunshine, I pretty much love it there. Also, we went to met some of our friends in California, we had a great time.What about you?</div>
    <br />
    <div>I am sorry? Where you have been?</div>
      <br />
  <div>So did you travel while you were back in china?</div>
    <br />  <br />  <br />
  <div>How did you get there? Train? </div>
    <br />  <br />
  <div>Well, you know, family business, just the dinner and presents and everything else you would expect.</div>
